1. Create a `index.js` file.
2. This is a solo assignment. Be sure to work through these problems on your own.

### Problem 1
You have an array called numbers with three elements: [1, 2, 3]. Destructure the array into three separate variables: first, second, and third, and assign the corresponding values. Print the value of second.

### Problem 2
Consider the following object:

```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York'
};
```
Using destructuring, extract the values of name and city from the person object and store them in variables called personName and personCity, respectively. Print the values of both variables.

### Problem 3
You have an object called car with the following properties:

```js
const car = {
  brand: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla',
  year: 2022
};
```

Use Object.keys to extract the keys of the car object into an array called keysArray. Print the keysArray.


### Problem 4
Using Object.values, extract the values from the car object defined in the previous problem and store them in an array called valuesArray. Print the valuesArray.

### Problem 5
Using Object.entries, extract both the keys and values from the car object defined earlier and store them in an array called entriesArray. Print the entriesArray.
